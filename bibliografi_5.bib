              period. Low volume = 3 sets per muscle group per week; moderate =
              6 sets; high = 12 sets. Twenty-seven men with 1--4 yrs weight
              training experience were randomly assigned to the different
              training volumes and trained 4 days a week. A periodized routine
              was used; exercises, training intensity, and number of training
              days were the same for each group. The only variation between
              conditions was the number of sets per exercise. Pre and post
              measurements assessed muscular size via ultrasound; strength via
              maximum squat and bench press; and power via vertical jump and
              bench press throw. Urinary concentrations of test-osterone and
              cortisol were also analyzed to assess the responses to training
              conditions. All 3 training volumes significantly (p < 0.05)
              increased muscle size, strength, and upper body power, with no
              significant between-group differences. There were no significant
              changes in hormonal concentrations. The results support the use

               Our results provide a novel contribution to the literature

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether variation in resistance
               exercise volume affects muscle function and physical performance
               response in older adults. DESIGN: A randomized trial with
               subjects assigned to a single-set (1-SET) or three-set (3-SET)
               exercise group. SETTING: An exercise facility at the University
               of Queensland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight community-dwelling men
               and women aged 65 to 78. INTERVENTION: Progressive resistance
               training consisting of seven exercises targeting the major
               muscle groups of the upper and lower body performed on exercise
               machines twice weekly for 20 weeks at eight-repetition maximum
               (RM) intensity. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle function included isotonic
               muscle strength (1-RM) of the seven exercises, isokinetic and
               isometric knee extensor strength, and muscle endurance for the
               chest press and leg press exercises. Physical performance
               included timed chair rise, usual and fast 6-m walk, 6-m
               backwards walk, 400-m walk, floor rise to standing, and stair
               climbing ability. In addition, body composition was determined
               using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Isotonic muscle
               strength increased in both exercise groups for all seven
               exercises (P<.01), with the gain in the 3-SET group greater
               (P<.05) for the seated row, triceps extension, and knee
               extension (analysis of covariance). Similarly, muscle endurance
               gains were greater for the 3-SET than the 1-SET group (P<.01),
               with no significant difference between groups for isokinetic and
               isometric knee extensor strength. Both groups improved (P<.05)
               in the chair rise (1-SET, 10.1\%; 3-SET, 13.6\%), 6-m backwards
               walk (1-SET, 14.3\%; 3-SET, 14.8\%), 400-m walk (1-SET, 3.8\%;
               3-SET, 7.4\%), and stair climbing test (1-SET, 7.7\%; 3-SET,
               6.4\%), with the only difference between groups for the 400-m
               walk (P<.05). There was no difference between groups for change
               in body composition. CONCLUSION: Resistance training consisting
               of only single-set exercises is sufficient to significantly
               enhance muscle function and physical performance, although
               muscle strength and endurance gains are greater with
               higher-volume work. These findings have application in designing
               time-efficient exercise regimens to enhance neuromuscular
               function in older adults.",

               a 1-set and 3-set strength training program. The subjects were
               untrained men and women who were randomly signed into 1 of 3
               groups: 10 subjects trained during the first 9 weeks (training
               period 1) with 1 set and 8-12 repetitions per set. After the
               break (9 weeks), they trained with 3 sets and 8-12 repetitions
               in training period 2. Twelve subjects started with the 3-set
               program and continued with the 1-set regime after the break. The
               control group (n = 7) did not train. The subjects were tested on
               1 repetition maximum (1RM) for the biceps curl, leg press
               (unilateral: left and right), and bench press. Analysis of the
               data was done in a sampled manner for each strength training
               program (1-set and 3-set). The 1-set (n = 22) and 3-set (n = 22)
               programs led to significantly (p < 0.05) improved 1RM
               performances in every exercise. The relative improvements (\%)
               for the 1RM were significantly higher during the 3-set program
               for the biceps curl and the bench press compared with the 1-set
               program. The control group exhibited no changes in any of the
               tested parameters over the course of this study. The design of
               this study allowed insight into the effects of different
               strength training volume without any genetical variations. The
               same subjects improved their 1RM during the 3-set program by 2.3
               kg (biceps curl; corresponding effect size = 0.24), 8.9 kg (leg
               press right; 0.30), 10.9 kg (leg press left; 0.28), and 2.5 kg
               (bench press; 0.09) more than during the 1-set program.
               Depending on the goals of each trainee, these differences
               between the effects of different strength training volumes
               indicate that it may be worth spending more time on working out

               a complex versus simple exercise on EMG, strength and regional
               body composition. Twenty-eight untrained men ( n=15) and women (

               BC exercise, and group 3 (C, n=10) was the control group.
               One-repetition maximums (1RMs) and EMG were measured in the LP
               and BC during pre-, mid-, and post-training. Lean body mass of
               the legs and arms were measured pre- and post-training by dual
               energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results of the study indicated that
               both S-1 and M-6 groups significantly increased percentage

               However, compared to S-1, M-6 showed a significantly greater
               increase in percentage strength in the BC ( P<or=0.05) from pre-

               pre- to mid-testing compared to S-1. There were no significant
               differences found in lean muscle mass gains for the legs or arms

               multiple sets produce a greater increase in percentage strength
               gain for a simple exercise. It is possible that some type of
               neural mechanism is responsible for the observed difference.",
