	abstract = {We examined hypertrophic outcomes of weekly graded whey protein dosing (GWP) vs. whey protein (WP) or maltodextrin (MALTO) dosed once daily during 6 weeks of high-volume resistance training (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age = 5 +/- 3 years; mean +/- SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein frequency was 3 d/week and each session involved 2 upper- and 2 lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from 10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants were assigned to WP (25 g/d; n = 10), MALTO (30 g/d; n = 10), or GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n = 11), and supplementation occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps brachii ultrasounds for muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3 (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p {\textless} 0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p {\textless} 0.05). However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p {\textless} 0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area ({\textasciitilde}+300 mum(2)). When examining the effects of training on LBM increases (DeltaLBM) in all participants combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p {\textless} 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85 kg, p {\textless} 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting DeltaLBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p {\textless} 0.001) but not MID to POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program, ECW-corrected DeltaLBM gains were largely dampened, but still positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded {\textasciitilde}20 sets/exercise/wk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many randomized trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at baseline and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores. RESULTS: ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.},

	doi = {10.1525/collabra.33267},
	abstract = {An important step when designing an empirical study is to justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},

	abstract = {Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents. Supplementary materials include an annotated set of links to step-by-step tutorials, real world examples, and other useful learning resources.},

  abstract = "This study examined the effects of different volumes of
              resistance training on muscle size and function over a 10-wk
              period. Low volume = 3 sets per muscle group per week; moderate =
              6 sets; high = 12 sets. Twenty-seven men with 1--4 yrs weight
              training experience were randomly assigned to the different
              training volumes and trained 4 days a week. A periodized routine
              was used; exercises, training intensity, and number of training
              days were the same for each group. The only variation between
              conditions was the number of sets per exercise. Pre and post
              measurements assessed muscular size via ultrasound; strength via
              maximum squat and bench press; and power via vertical jump and
              bench press throw. Urinary concentrations of test-osterone and
              cortisol were also analyzed to assess the responses to training
              conditions. All 3 training volumes significantly (p < 0.05)
              increased muscle size, strength, and upper body power, with no
              significant between-group differences. There were no significant
              changes in hormonal concentrations. The results support the use

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: To determine whether variation in resistance
               exercise volume affects muscle function and physical performance
               response in older adults. DESIGN: A randomized trial with
               subjects assigned to a single-set (1-SET) or three-set (3-SET)
               exercise group. SETTING: An exercise facility at the University
               of Queensland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight community-dwelling men
               and women aged 65 to 78. INTERVENTION: Progressive resistance
               training consisting of seven exercises targeting the major
               muscle groups of the upper and lower body performed on exercise
               machines twice weekly for 20 weeks at eight-repetition maximum
               (RM) intensity. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle function included isotonic
               muscle strength (1-RM) of the seven exercises, isokinetic and
               isometric knee extensor strength, and muscle endurance for the
               chest press and leg press exercises. Physical performance
               included timed chair rise, usual and fast 6-m walk, 6-m
               backwards walk, 400-m walk, floor rise to standing, and stair
               climbing ability. In addition, body composition was determined
               using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Isotonic muscle
               strength increased in both exercise groups for all seven
               exercises (P<.01), with the gain in the 3-SET group greater
               (P<.05) for the seated row, triceps extension, and knee
               extension (analysis of covariance). Similarly, muscle endurance
               gains were greater for the 3-SET than the 1-SET group (P<.01),
               with no significant difference between groups for isokinetic and
               isometric knee extensor strength. Both groups improved (P<.05)
               in the chair rise (1-SET, 10.1\%; 3-SET, 13.6\%), 6-m backwards
               walk (1-SET, 14.3\%; 3-SET, 14.8\%), 400-m walk (1-SET, 3.8\%;
               3-SET, 7.4\%), and stair climbing test (1-SET, 7.7\%; 3-SET,
               6.4\%), with the only difference between groups for the 400-m
               walk (P<.05). There was no difference between groups for change
               in body composition. CONCLUSION: Resistance training consisting
               of only single-set exercises is sufficient to significantly
               enhance muscle function and physical performance, although
               muscle strength and endurance gains are greater with
               higher-volume work. These findings have application in designing
               time-efficient exercise regimens to enhance neuromuscular
               function in older adults.",

               groups: 10 subjects trained during the first 9 weeks (training
               period 1) with 1 set and 8-12 repetitions per set. After the
               break (9 weeks), they trained with 3 sets and 8-12 repetitions

               program and continued with the 1-set regime after the break. The
               control group (n = 7) did not train. The subjects were tested on
               1 repetition maximum (1RM) for the biceps curl, leg press
               (unilateral: left and right), and bench press. Analysis of the
               data was done in a sampled manner for each strength training

               programs led to significantly (p < 0.05) improved 1RM
               performances in every exercise. The relative improvements (\%)
               for the 1RM were significantly higher during the 3-set program
               for the biceps curl and the bench press compared with the 1-set
               program. The control group exhibited no changes in any of the
               tested parameters over the course of this study. The design of
               this study allowed insight into the effects of different
               strength training volume without any genetical variations. The
               same subjects improved their 1RM during the 3-set program by 2.3

               press right; 0.30), 10.9 kg (leg press left; 0.28), and 2.5 kg
               (bench press; 0.09) more than during the 1-set program.
               Depending on the goals of each trainee, these differences
               between the effects of different strength training volumes
               indicate that it may be worth spending more time on working out

               One-repetition maximums (1RMs) and EMG were measured in the LP
