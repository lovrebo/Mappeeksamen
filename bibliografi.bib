  abstract  = "Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over

               explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise
               and sports-science research and routine testing, internal
               validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as
               exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional
               intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing,
               hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other
               potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate
               attention in sports physiology and performance research. These
               confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the
               test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of
               exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room,

  title     = "Measures of reliability in sports medicine and science",
  author    = "Hopkins, W G",
  abstract  = "Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test,
               assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same
               individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of
               single measurements and better tracking of changes in
               measurements in research or practical settings. The main
               measures of reliability are within-subject random variation,
               systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple,
               adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical
               (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an
               individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in
               sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed
               as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A
               biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the
               limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an
               individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes
               in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent
               such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes
               need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject
               variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly
               because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the
               sample of participants. Uses of reliability include
               decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests
               or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and
               estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the
               response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of
               reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at
               least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in
               reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs
               and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider
               understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error
               as the standard measure of reliability would improve the
               assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.",

              different high-intensity training (HIT) models, balanced for
              total load but differing in training plan progression, on
              endurance adaptations. METHODS: Sixty-three cyclists (peak oxygen
              uptake (V˙O2peak) 61.3 $\pm$ 5.8 mL·kg·min) were randomized to
              three training groups and instructed to follow a 12-wk training
              program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of
              low-intensity training, and laboratory testing. The increasing
              HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 $\times$ 16
              min in weeks 1-4, 4 $\times$ 8 min in weeks 5-8, and 4 $\times$ 4
              min in weeks 9-12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed
              interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the
              increasing HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed
              the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all
              mesocycles. Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session
              efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmol·L
              blood lactate in 4 $\times$ 16-, 4 $\times$ 8-, and 4 $\times$
              4-min sessions, respectively (P 0.05). Further, an individual
              response analysis indicated similar likelihood of large,
              moderate, or nonresponses, respectively, in response to each
              training group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that
              organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized
              mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk
              training period has little or no effect on training adaptation

              (RT). College-aged resistance-trained males (training age = 5
              $\pm$ 3 years; mean $\pm$ SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein
              frequency was 3 d/week and each session involved 2 upper- and 2
              lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from
              10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is
              the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants
              were assigned to WP (25 g/d; n = 10), MALTO (30 g/d; n = 10), or
              GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n = 11), and supplementation
              occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
              (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps brachii ultrasounds for
              muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy
              (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3
              (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for
              immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the
              greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p
              < 0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass
              [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p < 0.05).
              However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase
              in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p < 0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups
              experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber
              cross-sectional area (~+300 $\mu$m2). When examining the effects
              of training on LBM increases ($\Delta$LBM) in all participants
              combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p < 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85
              kg, p < 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting
              $\Delta$LBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to
              remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was
              observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p < 0.001) but not MID to
              POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP
              supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body
              composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases
              observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP
              supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal
              muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program,
              ECW-corrected $\Delta$LBM gains were largely dampened, but still
              positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded ~20

               30 participants. PRE-to-W6 HIGH and LOW responders exhibited a
               composite hypertrophy change of +10.7 $\pm$ 3.2 and -2.1 $\pm$
               1.6\%, respectively (p W3 > PRE), phospho (p)-4EBP1 (PRE >

               45S rRNA (PRE > W6), and muscle citrate synthase activity (PRE >
               W3\&W6). No interactions existed for the aforementioned
               biomarkers and/or other assayed targets (muscle 20S proteasome
               activity, serum total testosterone, muscle androgen receptor
               protein levels, muscle glycogen, or serum creatine kinase).
               Regression analysis indicated PRE type II fiber percentage (R 2

               change in the composite hypertrophy score. While our sample size

              6-day high-intensity interval (HIT) block [BLOCK, n = 12, maximal
              oxygen uptake (V̇O2max = 69. 6 $\pm$ 4.3 mL·min-1·kg-1)] with a
              time-matched period with usual training (CON, n = 12, V̇O2max =
              69.2 $\pm$ 4.2 mL·min-1·kg-1) in well-trained cross-country (XC)
              skiers on physiological determinants and indicators of endurance
              performance. Furthermore, the study aimed to investigate the
              acute physiological responses, including time $\geq$90\% of
              V̇O2max, and its associated reliability during repeated HIT
              sessions in the HIT microcycle. Methods: Before the 6-day HIT
              block and following 5 days of recovery after the HIT block, both
              groups were tested on indicators of endurance performance. To
              quantify time $\geq$90\% of V̇O2max during interval sessions in
              the HIT block, V̇O2 measurements were performed on the 1st, 2nd,
              and last HIT session in BLOCK. Results: BLOCK had a larger
              improvement than CON in maximal 1-min velocity achieved during
              the V̇O2max test (3.1 $\pm$ 3.1\% vs. 1.2 $\pm$ 1.6\%,
              respectively; p = 0.010) and velocity corresponding to 4 mmol·L-1
              blood lactate (3.2 $\pm$ 2.9\% vs. 0.6 $\pm$ 2.1\%, respectively;
              p = 0.024). During submaximal exercise, BLOCK displayed a larger
              reduction in respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate
              concentration, heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion (p <
              0.05) and a tendency towards less energy expenditure compared to
              CON (p = 0.073). The ICC of time $\geq$90\% V̇O2max in the
              present study was 0.57, which indicates moderate reliability.
              Conclusions: In well-trained XC skiers, BLOCK induced superior
              changes in indicators of endurance performance compared with CON,
              while time $\geq$90\% of V̇O2max during the HIT sessions in the
              6-day block had a moderate reliability.",

               responses to block- versus evenly-distributed high-intensity
               interval training (HIT) within a polarized microcycle. Methods:
               Twenty well-trained junior cross-country skiers (10 males, age
               17.6 $\pm$ 1.5 and 10 females, age 17.3 $\pm$ 1.5) completed
               two, 3-week periods of training (EVEN and BLOCK) in a
               randomized, crossover-design study. In EVEN, 3 HIT sessions (5
               $\times$ 4-min of diagonal-stride roller-skiing) were completed
               at a maximal sustainable intensity each week while low-intensity
               training (LIT) was distributed evenly around the HIT. In BLOCK,
               the same 9 HIT sessions were completed in the second week while
               only LIT was completed in the first and third weeks. Heart rate
               (HR), session ratings of perceived exertion (sRPE), and
               perceived recovery (pREC) were recorded for all HIT and LIT
               sessions, while distance covered was recorded for each HIT
               interval. The recovery-stress questionnaire for athletes
               (RESTQ-Sport) was completed weekly. Before and after EVEN and
               BLOCK, resting saliva and muscle samples were collected and an
               incremental test and 600-m time-trial (TT) were completed.
               Results: Pre- to post-testing revealed no significant
               differences between EVEN and BLOCK for changes in resting
               salivary cortisol, testosterone, or IgA, or for changes in
               muscle capillary density, fiber area, fiber composition, enzyme
               activity (CS, HAD, and PFK) or the protein content of VEGF or
               PGC-1$\alpha$. Neither were any differences observed in the
               changes in skiing economy, [Formula: see text] or 600-m
               time-trial performance between interventions. These findings
               were coupled with no significant differences between EVEN and
               BLOCK for distance covered during HIT, summated HR zone scores,
               total sRPE training load, overall pREC or overall
               recovery-stress state. However, 600-m TT performance improved
               from pre- to post-training, irrespective of intervention (P =
               0.003), and a number of hormonal and muscle biopsy markers were
               also significantly altered post-training (P < 0.05). Discussion:
               The current study shows that well-trained junior cross-country
               skiers are able to complete 9 HIT sessions within 1 week without
               compromising total work done and without experiencing greater
               stress or reduced recovery over a 3-week polarized microcycle.
               However, the findings do not support block-distributed HIT as a
               superior method to a more even distribution of HIT in terms of
               enhancing physiological or performance adaptions.",

               performance responses to a 2-wk block of increased training load
               and compared whether responses differ between high-intensity
               interval (HIIT) and low-intensity training (LIT). METHODS:
               Thirty recreationally trained males and females performed a 2-wk
               block of 10 HIIT sessions (INT, n = 15) or 70\% increased volume
               of LIT (VOL, n = 15). Running time in the 3000 m and basal serum
               and urine hormone concentrations were measured before (T1) and
               after the block (T2), and after a recovery week (T3). In
               addition, weekly averages of nocturnal heart rate variability
               (HRV) and perceived recovery were compared with the baseline.
               RESULTS: Both groups improved their running time in the 3000 m
               from T1 to T2 (INT = -1.8\% $\pm$ 1.6\%, P = 0.003; VOL = -1.4\%
               $\pm$ 1.7\%, P = 0.017) and from T1 to T3 (INT = -2.5\% $\pm$
               1.6\%, P < 0.001; VOL = -2.2\% $\pm$ 1.9\%, P = 0.001). Resting
               norepinephrine concentration increased in INT from T1 to T2 (P =
               0.01) and remained elevated at T3 (P = 0.018). The change in HRV
               from the baseline was different between the groups during the
               first week (INT = -1.0\% $\pm$ 2.0\% vs VOL = 1.8\% $\pm$ 3.2\%,
               P = 0.008). Muscle soreness increased only in INT (P < 0.001),
               and the change was different compared with VOL across the block
               and recovery weeks (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HIIT and LIT blocks
               increased endurance performance in a short period. Although both
               protocols seemed to be tolerable for recreational athletes, a
               HIIT block may induce some negative responses such as increased

               subjects assigned to a single-set (1-SET) or three-set (3-SET)
               exercise group. SETTING: An exercise facility at the University
               of Queensland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight community-dwelling men
               and women aged 65 to 78. INTERVENTION: Progressive resistance
               training consisting of seven exercises targeting the major
               muscle groups of the upper and lower body performed on exercise
               machines twice weekly for 20 weeks at eight-repetition maximum
               (RM) intensity. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle function included isotonic
               muscle strength (1-RM) of the seven exercises, isokinetic and
               isometric knee extensor strength, and muscle endurance for the
               chest press and leg press exercises. Physical performance
               included timed chair rise, usual and fast 6-m walk, 6-m
               backwards walk, 400-m walk, floor rise to standing, and stair
               climbing ability. In addition, body composition was determined
               using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: Isotonic muscle
               strength increased in both exercise groups for all seven
               exercises (P<.01), with the gain in the 3-SET group greater
               (P<.05) for the seated row, triceps extension, and knee
               extension (analysis of covariance). Similarly, muscle endurance
               gains were greater for the 3-SET than the 1-SET group (P<.01),
               with no significant difference between groups for isokinetic and
               isometric knee extensor strength. Both groups improved (P<.05)
               in the chair rise (1-SET, 10.1\%; 3-SET, 13.6\%), 6-m backwards
               walk (1-SET, 14.3\%; 3-SET, 14.8\%), 400-m walk (1-SET, 3.8\%;
               3-SET, 7.4\%), and stair climbing test (1-SET, 7.7\%; 3-SET,
               6.4\%), with the only difference between groups for the 400-m
               walk (P<.05). There was no difference between groups for change
               in body composition. CONCLUSION: Resistance training consisting
               of only single-set exercises is sufficient to significantly
               enhance muscle function and physical performance, although
               muscle strength and endurance gains are greater with
               higher-volume work. These findings have application in designing

               ideas and a slow growth of research from the late 1890s through

               a complex versus simple exercise on EMG, strength and regional
               body composition. Twenty-eight untrained men ( n=15) and women (
               n=13) performed resistance training twice per week. Group 1
               (S-1, n=9) performed one set of a leg press (LP) and bicep curl
               (BC) exercise, group 2 (M-6, n=9) performed six sets of a LP and
               BC exercise, and group 3 (C, n=10) was the control group.
               One-repetition maximums (1RMs) and EMG were measured in the LP
               and BC during pre-, mid-, and post-training. Lean body mass of
               the legs and arms were measured pre- and post-training by dual
               energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results of the study indicated that
               both S-1 and M-6 groups significantly increased percentage
               strength pre- to post-training in both the LP and BC [S-1

               pre-/post-LP=52.6 (12.6)\%, BC=22.8 (15.6)\%; mean (SD)].
               However, compared to S-1, M-6 showed a significantly greater
               increase in percentage strength in the BC ( P<or=0.05) from pre-
               to post-testing. Results also showed that M-6 produced a
               significant increase in biceps (single-joint) muscle EMG values
               pre- to mid-testing compared to S-1. There were no significant
               differences found in lean muscle mass gains for the legs or arms
               in either training group. The data from this study suggest that
               multiple sets produce a greater increase in percentage strength
               gain for a simple exercise. It is possible that some type of
               neural mechanism is responsible for the observed difference.",

  abstract  = "During resistance training the muscle undergoes many changes.
               Possibly the most profound and significant changes are those
               that occur in the muscles contractile proteins. Increases in
               these contractile proteins are one of the primary factors
               contributing to myofibrillar hypertrophy. The most abundant
               muscle protein is myosin, which comprises 25\% of the total
               muscle protein. Due to the large amount of skeletal muscle that
               is composed of myosin, changes in this fiber may have profound
               effects on skeletal muscle size and strength. The myosin
               molecule is made up of 6 subunits, 2 very large heavy chains,
               and 4 smaller light chains. The myosin heavy chain (MHC)
               accounts for 25-30\% of all muscle proteins making its size an
               important factor in skeletal muscle growth. In conjunction with
               resistance training, dietary protein intake must be adequate to
               illicit positive adaptations. Although many studies have
               evaluated the role of dietary protein intake on skeletal muscle
               changes, few have evaluated the MHC specifically. Research has
               clearly defined the need for dietary protein and resistance
               training to facilitate positive changes in skeletal muscle. The
