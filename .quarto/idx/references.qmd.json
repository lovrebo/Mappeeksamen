College-aged resistance-trained males (training age = 5 +/- 3 years; mean +/- SD) performed 6 weeks of RT wherein frequency was 3 d/week and each session involved 2 upper- and 2 lower-body exercises (10 repetitions/set). Volume increased from 10 sets/exercise (week 1) to 32 sets/exercise (week 6), which is the highest volume investigated in this timeframe. Participants were assigned to WP (25 g/d; n = 10), MALTO (30 g/d; n = 10), or GWP (25-150 g/d from weeks 1-6; n = 11), and supplementation occurred throughout training. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), vastus lateralis (VL), and biceps brachii ultrasounds for muscle thicknesses, and bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (BIS) were performed prior to training (PRE) and after weeks 3 (MID) and 6 (POST). VL biopsies were also collected for immunohistochemical staining. The GWP group experienced the greatest PRE to POST reduction in DXA fat mass (FM) (-1.00 kg, p {\\textless} 0.05), and a robust increase in DXA fat- and bone-free mass [termed lean body mass (LBM) throughout] (+2.93 kg, p {\\textless} 0.05). However, the MALTO group also experienced a PRE to POST increase in DXA LBM (+2.35 kg, p {\\textless} 0.05), and the GWP and MALTO groups experienced similar PRE to POST increases in type II muscle fiber cross-sectional area ({\\textasciitilde}+300 mum(2)). When examining the effects of training on LBM increases (DeltaLBM) in all participants combined, PRE to MID (+1.34 kg, p {\\textless} 0.001) and MID to POST (+0.85 kg, p {\\textless} 0.001) increases were observed. However, when adjusting DeltaLBM for extracellular water (ECW) changes, intending to remove the confounder of edema, a significant increase was observed from PRE to MID (+1.18 kg, p {\\textless} 0.001) but not MID to POST (+0.25 kg; p = 0.131). Based upon DXA data, GWP supplementation may be a viable strategy to improve body composition during high-volume RT. However, large LBM increases observed in the MALTO group preclude us from suggesting that GWP supplementation is clearly superior in facilitating skeletal muscle hypertrophy. With regard to the implemented RT program, ECW-corrected DeltaLBM gains were largely dampened, but still positive, in resistance-trained participants when RT exceeded {\\textasciitilde}20 sets/exercise/wk.},\n\tlanguage = {eng},\n\tjournal = {Front Nutr},\n\tauthor = {Haun, C.

In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores. RESULTS: ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.},\n\tlanguage = {eng},\n\tjournal = {BMC Med Res Methodol},\n\tauthor = {Vickers, A.

The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},\n\tlanguage = {en},\n\tnumber = {1},\n\turldate = {2022-04-18},\n\tjournal = {Collabra: Psychology},\n\tauthor = {Lakens, DaniÃ«l},\n\tmonth = mar,\n\tyear = {2022},\n\tpages = {33267},\n\tfile = {Fulltekst:C\\:\\\\Users\\\\706194\\\\Zotero\\\\storage\\\\C457SA9E\\\\Lakens - 2022 - Sample Size Justification.pdf:application/pdf},\n}\n\n\n\n@techreport{bryan_2017,\n\ttype = {preprint},\n\ttitle = {Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?},\n\turl = {https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2},\n\tabstract = {Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents.

METHODS: Sixty-three cyclists (peak oxygen\n              uptake (VËO2peak) 61.3 $\\pm$ 5.8 mLÂ·kgÂ·min) were randomized to\n              three training groups and instructed to follow a 12-wk training\n              program consisting of 24 interval sessions, a high volume of\n              low-intensity training, and laboratory testing. The increasing\n              HIT group (n = 23) performed interval training as 4 $\\times$ 16\n              min in weeks 1-4, 4 $\\times$ 8 min in weeks 5-8, and 4 $\\times$ 4\n              min in weeks 9-12. The decreasing HIT group (n = 20) performed\n              interval sessions in the opposite mesocycle order as the\n              increasing HIT group, and the mixed HIT group (n = 20) performed\n              the interval prescriptions in a mixed distribution in all\n              mesocycles. Interval sessions were prescribed as maximal session\n              efforts and executed at mean values 4.7, 9.2, and 12.7 mmolÂ·L\n              blood lactate in 4 $\\times$ 16-, 4 $\\times$ 8-, and 4 $\\times$\n              4-min sessions, respectively (P 0.05).

CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that\n              organizing different interval sessions in a specific periodized\n              mesocycle order or in a mixed distribution during a 12-wk\n              training period has little or no effect on training adaptation\n              when the overall training load is the same.\",\n  journal  = \"Med.

Results: BLOCK had a larger\n              improvement than CON in maximal 1-min velocity achieved during\n              the VÌO2max test (3.1 $\\pm$ 3.1\\% vs. 1.2 $\\pm$ 1.6\\%,\n              respectively; p = 0.010) and velocity corresponding to 4 mmolÂ·L-1\n              blood lactate (3.2 $\\pm$ 2.9\\% vs. 0.6 $\\pm$ 2.1\\%, respectively;\n              p = 0.024). During submaximal exercise, BLOCK displayed a larger\n              reduction in respiratory exchange ratio, blood lactate\n              concentration, heart rate, and rate of perceived exertion (p <\n              0.05) and a tendency towards less energy expenditure compared to\n              CON (p = 0.073).

SETTING: An exercise facility at the University\n               of Queensland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight community-dwelling men\n               and women aged 65 to 78. INTERVENTION: Progressive resistance\n               training consisting of seven exercises targeting the major\n               muscle groups of the upper and lower body performed on exercise\n               machines twice weekly for 20 weeks at eight-repetition maximum\n               (RM) intensity. MEASUREMENTS: Muscle function included isotonic\n               muscle strength (1-RM) of the seven exercises, isokinetic and\n               isometric knee extensor strength, and muscle endurance for the\n               chest press and leg press exercises.

RESULTS: Isotonic muscle\n               strength increased in both exercise groups for all seven\n               exercises (P<.01), with the gain in the 3-SET group greater\n               (P<.05) for the seated row, triceps extension, and knee\n               extension (analysis of covariance). Similarly, muscle endurance\n               gains were greater for the 3-SET than the 1-SET group (P<.01),\n               with no significant difference between groups for isokinetic and\n               isometric knee extensor strength. Both groups improved (P<.05)\n               in the chair rise (1-SET, 10.1\\%; 3-SET, 13.6\\%), 6-m backwards\n               walk (1-SET, 14.3\\%; 3-SET, 14.8\\%), 400-m walk (1-SET, 3.8\\%;\n               3-SET, 7.4\\%), and stair climbing test (1-SET, 7.7\\%; 3-SET,\n               6.4\\%), with the only difference between groups for the 400-m\n               walk (P<.05).

This brief review highlights some of the\n               important scientific contributions to the evolution of our\n               scientific study of resistance training and provides a\n               literature base analysis for greater quantification of the\n               origins and expanse of such investigations.\",\n  journal   = \"Sports Med.\",\n  publisher = \"Springer Science and Business Media LLC\",\n  volume    =  47,\n  number    =  12,\n  pages     = \"2415--2435\",\n  month     =  dec,\n  year      =  2017,\n  language  = \"en\"\n}\n\n\n@article{McBride,\n  title     = \"Effect of resistance exercise volume and complexity on {EMG},\n               strength, and regional body composition\",\n  author    = \"McBride, Jeffrey M and Blaak, John B and Triplett-McBride,\n               Travis\",\n  abstract  = \"This study was designed to examine the effects of a 12-week\n               resistance training program using single versus multiple sets of\n               a complex versus simple exercise on EMG, strength and regional\n               body composition. Twenty-eight untrained men ( n=15) and women (\n               n=13) performed resistance training twice per week. Group 1\n               (S-1, n=9) performed one set of a leg press (LP) and bicep curl\n               (BC) exercise, group 2 (M-6, n=9) performed six sets of a LP and\n               BC exercise, and group 3 (C, n=10) was the control group.\n               One-repetition maximums (1RMs) and EMG were measured in the LP\n               and BC during pre-, mid-, and post-training. Lean body mass of\n               the legs and arms were measured pre- and post-training by dual\n               energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results of the study indicated that\n               both S-1 and M-6 groups significantly increased percentage\n               strength pre- to post-training in both the LP and BC [S-1\n               pre-/post-LP=41.2 (23.7)\\%, BC=8.5 (6.71)\\%; M-6\n               pre-/post-LP=52.6 (12.6)\\%, BC=22.8 (15.6)\\%; mean (SD)].\n               However, compared to S-1, M-6 showed a significantly greater\n               increase in percentage strength in the BC ( P<or=0.05) from pre-\n               to post-testing. Results also showed that M-6 produced a\n               significant increase in biceps (single-joint) muscle EMG values\n               pre- to mid-testing compared to S-1. There were no significant\n               differences found in lean muscle mass gains for the legs or arms\n               in either training group. The data from this study suggest that\n               multiple sets produce a greater increase in percentage strength\n               gain for a simple exercise. It is possible that some type of\n               neural mechanism is responsible for the observed difference.\",\n  journal   = \"Eur. J. Appl.
